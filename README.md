# SMCAD dataset synthesis algorithm and graph data extraction algorithm
## Introduction
This repository contains code for generating and extracting graph data from the sheet metal part machining feature dataset (named the SMCAD dataset), which is mentioned in the paper "Adaptive recognition of machining features in sheet metal parts based on a graph class-incremental learning strategy."
### The "generate_database" folder contains Python scripts for generating labeled sheet metal part CAD models, while the "data_pretreatment" folder contains Python scripts for extracting maFEG graph data.
